A web application (or web app) is application software that runs on a web server.(alternative)
Web applications are accessed by the user through a web browser with an active network connection.
These applications are programmed using a clientâ€“server modeled structure(alternative).
Examples of commonly-used web applications include: web-mail, online retail sales, online banking, and online auctions.
Single-page applications are more application-like because they reject the more typical web paradigm of moving between distinct pages with different URLs.
